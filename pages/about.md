# **About Me**

Hi I am Lan :wave:,<br>
I’m an indie nerd who longs to create unique game worlds. My knowledge stands at the intersection between software engineering, storytelling, and digital media.

When I was 14, I bought my first game console 3DS with pocket money, and my life has taken a different direction. I’m deeply fascinated by video games, especially the ones created by Nintendo. 

But my interests don’t stop there. I’m also fascinated by the immersive potential of AR/VR technology and love exploring its ability to blend the virtual with reality. AI is another area that intrigues me, and taking an Artificial Intelligence course at BCIT gave me deep insights into the technology's future. Beyond software, I’ve been drawing for over 13 years, and recently I’ve been diving into 3D modeling—bringing my creativity into the digital realm.

Whether it’s building game worlds, exploring AR/VR, or experimenting with AI, I’m always excited to create something new.
