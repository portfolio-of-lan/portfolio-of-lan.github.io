Description
</h3>
<br>

Given a dataset of network traffic records, this projects aims to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System capable of analyzing network traffic records to classify them as normal or malicious, as well as identifying the specific category of attacks if present.

About
</h3>
<br>

This is a course project for my Artificial Intelligence class. In this project, I:
- Processed the dataset, including dataset splitting, imputing missing values, factoring categorical variables, and removing outliers.
- Selected from 47 features to build a classification model using Random Forest, to predict both binary and categorical labels (is attack or not, and attack category).
- Fine-tuned the model with halving random search.
