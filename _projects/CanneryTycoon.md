Description
</h3>

<br>
Currently, the visitors to the Steveston Cannery in Richmond, BC, are mostly students from middle schools, retired seniors, or families with young kids. However, the Cannery is striking to attract tourists of a wider range of ages.
By bringing attention to this unique cultural landmark, the game will help promote tourism and support the preservation of the cannery's legacy for future generations.

The project is a 2D video game, dedicated to bringing traffic to the Steveston Cannery, by simulating the process of catching and canning fish, supporting preservation and cultural significance for future generations.

About
</h3>
<br>

In this project, I was the designer and developer working with another developer and two artists. 
My contributions are as follows:

- Designed and developed core game mechanics involving time-based salmon processing, requiring players to click at specific machines to prevent spoilage and avoid financial loss.
- Created an interactive tutorial system using YarnSpinner plugin to guide players through gameplay mechanics with dynamic dialogue and visual prompts.
- Organized and implemented background music, machine sounds, and player interaction feedback using Unity's audio system tools.
- Implemented the shop UI with the DoTween plugin to add smooth animations and transitions.
