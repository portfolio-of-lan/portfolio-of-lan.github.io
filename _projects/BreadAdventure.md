About
</h3>
<br>
This is a simple platform game developed during my C# course. This game was completed by a group work of three. For my part, I designed the characters, did the animation, made the tilemap and all the other art related works. Other than that, I was responsible for implementing the logic of camera following, scene transition, audio management, and item collection. I also improved the logic of player movement, especially the part of wall jump and wall slide.

This is my first game made with Unity engine, and it's not very polished yet. I learned a lot from tutorials on the Internet, and got familiar with Unity and C# during the development process. I also learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage the project, which was a big progress for me.

The game draws on another game called <i>StrangeKeyworld</i> from a Japanese developer.
