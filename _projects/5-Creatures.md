Description
</h3>
<br>

This VR pet simulation game was developed as part of one of my course projects, designed to provide an immersive experience for people who cannot own a real pet. Through virtual reality, players can enjoy the joy of pet ownership in an engaging and interactive environment.

About
</h3>
<br>

Developing this VR pet simulation game was my first venture into VR development, which presented a steep learning curve. On top of that, the project timeline was extremely tight, giving me only three weeks to complete the game. As the sole developer, I was responsible for every aspect of the game, from importing assets and setting up the environment to implementing interactions and animations. Balancing these tasks with learning the complexities of VR technology in such a short timeframe was a significant challenge.


To tackle this, I took a proactive approach to learning. I turned to online resources, particularly YouTube tutorials, to quickly familiarize myself with the fundamentals of VR development. I dedicated extensive hours to researching and experimenting with VR mechanics, focusing on implementing effective hand and ray controls, interactions, and pet behaviors. By maintaining a disciplined workflow and staying resourceful, I was able to complete the project within the tight deadline, ensuring it was both functional and engaging.

##### My Responsibilities:

- Imported 3D models, built the game environment, and set up lighting and rendering (using a simple toon shader for a stylized look).
- Set up VR hand and ray control, enabling interactions such as hover, grab, and distant grab with XR interactable components.
- Implemented pet interactions, allowing users to touch the pet, which triggers specific animations and particle effects.
- Developed the feature where players can instruct the pet by clicking on specific locations or placing food, with the pet navigating using NavMeshAgent.
