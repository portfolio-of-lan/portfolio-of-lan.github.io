About
</h3>

<br>
It's the project for Ludum Dare 50, and we had 3 artists and 2 programmers. 
I was responsible for the generation of chambers in the game, as it's a roguelike game. Besides, I did everything about the behavior of a player, such as movement, attack, animation. I took the UI part as well.

It was the second game jam for me. Luckily, I don't have to do the art assets anymore since we had extra artists, and I had chance to participate more in programming. The biggest challenge is how to generate chambers randomly, and I used procedural algorithm to implement that. I was more proficient on making games and that was a huge progress for me.

Introduction
</h3>

You are a regular employee who doesn't always get enough sleep. All the overwhelming work has made you so exhausted.

Now it's morning and you are in your dreams. Try to break all your clocks or annoying trumpet/electric drill to get a nice sleep. In other words, delay the inevitable get-up!

Monsters
</h3>
<br>

#### Clock

The most common monster. It moves its tiny body towards you and shoots at you.

#### Digital Clock

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuppyGummy/ImageHosting/main/SweetBedtimeO'Mine/BlueRun1.png?token=ALASXQWNNKSAD6AHWOHKERDGOJXVI)
They're timid and run away from you. You need to attack them in a specific order to destroy them.

#### Electric Drill

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuppyGummy/ImageHosting/main/SweetBedtimeO'Mine/DrillIdle1.png?token=ALASXQXHTJ3O5IVIK3PVAM3GOJXSS)

Yep, It's the thing that your annoying neighbor uses every time you tryna sleep. It rushes everywhere and you need to dodge them quickly.

#### Pendulum

It sure looks dumb, but watch out for its bomb!

### Trumpet

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuppyGummy/ImageHosting/main/SweetBedtimeO'Mine/TrumpetIdle4.png?token=ALASXQVSQF62YZ2ZIZKEW2TGOJXOK)

Its sound wave is destructive, so beat it before it gets you.
