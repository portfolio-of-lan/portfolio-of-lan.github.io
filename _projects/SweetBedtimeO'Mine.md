About
</h3>

<br>
It's the project for Ludum Dare 50, and we had 3 artists and 2 programmers. 
I was responsible for the generation of chambers in the game, as it's a roguelike game. Besides, I did everything about the behavior of a player, such as movement, attack, animation. I took the UI part as well.

It was the second game jam for me. Luckily, I don't have to do the art assets anymore since we had extra artists, and I had chance to participate more in programming. The biggest challenge is how to generate chambers randomly, and I used procedural algorithm to implement that. I was more proficient on making games and that was a huge progress for me.

Now it's morning and you are in your dreams. Try to break all your clocks or annoying trumpet/electric drill to get a nice sleep. In other words, delay the inevitable get-up!

Monsters
</h3>
<br>

#### Clock

The most common monster. It moves its tiny body towards you and shoots at you.

#### Digital Clock

They're timid and run away from you. You need to attack them in a specific order to destroy them.

#### Electric Drill

Yep, It's the thing that your annoying neighbor uses every time you tryna sleep. It rushes everywhere and you need to dodge them quickly.

#### Pendulum

It sure looks dumb, but watch out for its bomb!

### Trumpet

Its sound wave is destructive, so beat it before it gets you.
