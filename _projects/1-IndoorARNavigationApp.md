Description
</h3>
<br>

BC Children's Hospital is facing navigation challenges due to their large and complex campus, leading to confusion, appointment delays, and clinic disruptions. This project aimed to resolve this by developing an augmented reality (AR) navigation app using ARKit and advanced navigation technologies. The app overlays real-time directional cues onto users' mobile devices, allowing them to easily find specific departments and services. The solution enables the hospital to manage and modify navigation routes, enhancing the overall experience for patients, visitors, and staff.

About
</h3>
<br>

This is a 12-week client project in cooperation with Digital Lab, BC Children's Hospital. In this project, I have accomplished the following tasks:
- Implemented indoor navigation using pre-built building models and NavMesh, utilizing visual markers for positioning.
- Developed customizable AR content (text, images, videos) using ARAnchor, enabling placement, deletion, and editing of transform, to serve as points of interest.
- Implemented local saving and loading of ARAnchor using ARKit's ARWorldMap.
- Enabled cross-device AR content sharing via Firebase for a consistent user experience.
