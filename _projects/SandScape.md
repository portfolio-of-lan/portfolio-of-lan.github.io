Description
</h3>
<br>

SandScape initiative focuses on delivering an engaging, virtual sand tray therapy platform explicitly designed for children and teenagers in Vancouver who have experienced trauma and find traditional therapy challenging in collaboration with BC Children's Hospital Digital Lab. The project aims to provide a safe and interactive space for children to express themselves and explore their emotions through the use of a virtual sand tray.

About
</h3>
<br>

This is a 12-week client project for my masters program. In this project, I was collaborating with another developer on the implementation of features. I was maily responsible for the following tasks:
- The interaction with miniatures, including 
  - spawning the object
  - selecting the object
  - dragging
  - rotating
  - scaling
  - burying the object
  - resetting
  - deleting
  - locking the object
- Integration of gizmo control
- Undo and redo
- Save and load
- Camera control

Compared to my other project, this was a relatively big project, and it turned out to be a great experience for me to work with a team and to learn how to collaborate with others. I also learned a lot about version control with Git and how to manage a project with multiple developers.
