About
</h3>

<br>
It's the project for Ludum Dare 50, and we had 3 artists and 2 programmers. 
I was responsible for the generation of chambers in the game, as it's a roguelike game. Besides, I did everything about the behavior of a player, such as movement, attack, animation. I took the UI part as well.

It was the second game jam for me. Luckily, I don't have to do the art assets anymore since we had extra artists, and I had chance to participate more in programming. The biggest challenge is how to generate chambers randomly, and I used procedural algorithm to implement that. I was more proficient on making games and that was a huge progress for me.
