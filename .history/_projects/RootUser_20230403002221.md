About
</h3>

<br>
This was my third game jam project and my second puzzle game. In this project, there are 2 artists and 2 programmers. This game maily depends on dialogues to proceed, and I was in charge of this part. I also designed part of the story and puzzles.

Unlike the previous projects, I had different teammates I was the leader of this project since I was the only experienced one. This enabled me to practice my leading skills
