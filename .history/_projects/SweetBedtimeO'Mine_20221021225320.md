Introduction
</h3>
<br>

You are a regular employee who doesn't always get enough sleep. All the overwhelming work has made you so exhausted.

Now it's morning and you are in your dreams. Try to break all your clocks or annoying trumpet/electric drill to get a nice sleep. In other words, delay the inevitable get-up!

## Monsters

### Clock

![ClockWalk1.png](///raw/a34/f3/z/4df73.png)

The most common monster. It moves its tiny body towards you and shoots at you.

### Digital Clock

They're timid and run away from you. You need to attack them in a specific order to destroy them.

### Electric Drill

Yep, It's the thing that your annoying neighbor uses every time you tryna sleep. It rushes everywhere and you need to dodge them quickly.

### Pendulum

It sure looks dumb, but watch out for its bomb!

### Trumpet

Its sound wave is destructive, so beat it before it gets you.
