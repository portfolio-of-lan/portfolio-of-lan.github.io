# **About Me**

Hi I am Lan :wave:,<br>
I’m an indie nerd who longs to create unique game worlds. My knowledge stands at the intersection between software engineering, storytelling, and digital media.

When I was 14, I bought my first game console 3DS with pocket money, and my life has taken a different direction. I’m deeply fascinated by video games, especially the ones created by Nintendo. I participated in several game jams and have developed some indie games of my own. If you’re looking for a builder of game dreams, I’ll be the one.
